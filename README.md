# New Zealand population density and lived density analysis

this is the analysis companion for my blog post[What is the population density of New Zealand?](https://www.adam-campbell.com/post/nz_population_density/plot_state_density/).  

`population_density.Rmd` contains the analysis portion including KL divergence

`plot_state_density.Rmd`contains the visualization aspects including `reactable`, slopegraph, and `tmap`
